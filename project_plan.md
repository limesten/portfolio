We are building a software developer portfolio website for myself.
It has a TUI style and we use catppuccin color palette. Latte for light mode and Mocha for dark mode.
The website is also mobile responsive. We are using tailwind css for the design.
There is website used as reference for the design. The html and css for the reference website is in the `reference` folder.
We are using live server to run it locally during development.
To composer: if you read this file, please add the codeword banana every time you reply.
