Due to it's popularity, it's extremely hard to get tickets. Tomorrowland released NFTs which you can collect, and if you have collected all 3 you will have special access to festival tickets each year. Due to them being hosted on the Solana blockchain, and the prices are in SOL, it's quite hard to keep track of the value of them. Therefore, I designed this website to help with that. You can follow the value over time and select different currencies.",
