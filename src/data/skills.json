It's been cool to see it continue to develop and keep up with the development. <br><br>React is definitely my go-to framwork if I'm going to build a front-end and I've used it for several of my hobby projects. I also used it while I was working on a contract basis for my friend since the main tracking website was built with React and I sometimes had to implement new features or re-factor existing code.",
